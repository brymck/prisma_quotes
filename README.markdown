**_This package is no longer actively maintained._**

I'm happy about all the positive feedback this has received over the years, but
I no longer have the time to dedicate to this project. The last holdout to have
not changed its web API, Google, finally changed its service in December 2017
so that this extension no longer works. To be quite honest, I'm surprised it
made it this far.

This work is released under the MIT License, so please feel free to build off
it... although honestly, the JavaScript world has moved on a great deal in the
last five years, and this isn't the best thing I've ever written.

Prisma Quotes
=============

[Why this extension requests certain permissions](http://code.google.com/p/prisma-quotes/wiki/PermissionsRequestJustification)

Key features:

  * Real-time updating of security quotes - You can choose among several quote
    providers for each quote, including Bloomberg, Google Finance and Yahoo!
    Finance. All of these services have their strengths and weaknesses with
    market coverage, charting tools and personal portfolios, so why choose
    between them?
  * Easy access to charts - Just click the quote and it will display the
    chart!
  * Alert conditions - Set an alert condition (i.e. ">5" means "alert me when
    the price is greater than 5") and you'll be notified when a security's
    price meets that condition.
  * Embed quote information in pages - For those who always want their quotes
    visible, turn this option on and quotes will float in the top right corner
    of web pages as though the popup window were always on.
  * Sync across computers (experimental) - Multiple computers? If you have
    bookmark syncing enabled in Chrome, you can turn this on and make sure all
    settings are synced across your machines.
  * Track portfolio performance - Enter the price per share and the number of
    shares in the options page, and you can see how your portfolio has
    performed for the day and in total.
  * Multiple portfolios - Create as many portfolios as you'd like!

To add your own ticker symbols, just visit the options page (accessible via
both the right-click menu and the popup window). Instructions are there,
although it mostly just involves you typing a ticker symbol and selecting the
quote service you wish to use. You can also edit which metrics you want to see
in the columns displayed, as well as the update frequency.

The default portfolio is there for demonstration: you can track domestic and
foreign stocks, 3-month LIBOR, exchange rates, swap rates, indexes tracking
everything from the broad market to the dollar to volatility, and futures.
Heck, I've even thrown in the 5Y senior EUR CDS on Greece. You can clear
everything in the options screen with the Clear button and start your own.

Note that for some securities, certain price data and charts aren't available.

Happy investing!
